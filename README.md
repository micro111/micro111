# Things I've made so far   
  ・Discord Music Bot (Python || Node.js)  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cast the sound source from youtube.   
  ・Discord Object Detection BOT (Python)  
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combining Yolo-v3 and discord, Yolo-v3 recognizes objects from images sent to discord.    
  ・Automation Annotation tool (Python)    
  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Use OpenCV tracking to crop an image from a video, detect an object and continue to set a bound box.   
  ・Node File Uploader (Node.js,HTML)     
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a site that uses the Bin method for transferring data from HTML to the server.
I built it myself for speed, but it's slower than a turtle over a WAN, seriously.   
  ・Node Chat Web site (Node.js,HTML)     
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a site where multiple people can chat in real time. Now you can chat with your friends during class.Yay!  
  ・Node Web site (Node.js,HTML,CSS)    
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  You can watch the news in real time and see today's weather.
There is no demand for it.   
     
  ・I forget the rest. (´ ﾟ д ﾟ ｀)
